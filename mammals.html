    <h2>Mammals</h2>
    <p>Mammals are a class of vertebrate animals characterized by several unique features. They are warm-blooded, meaning they can maintain a constant body temperature, often higher than their surroundings. Mammals possess hair or fur, which helps them regulate their body temperature and provides insulation. They also have mammary glands, allowing them to produce milk to nourish their young.</p>
    <p>Mammals give birth to live young and exhibit various reproductive strategies, including internal fertilization. They have a highly developed brain, enabling complex behaviors and cognitive abilities. Mammals exhibit a wide range of sizes, from the tiny bumblebee bat to the massive blue whale.</p>
    <p>Mammals are found in diverse habitats worldwide, including land, air, and water. They occupy various ecological niches and play crucial roles in ecosystems as predators, herbivores, or omnivores. Mammals have diverse dentition, including specialized teeth for different diets, such as sharp incisors for tearing meat or broad molars for grinding plant material.</p>
    <p>Some notable mammalian groups include primates (including humans), carnivores (such as lions and wolves), rodents (such as mice and squirrels), and cetaceans (whales and dolphins). Mammals have evolved over millions of years and have adapted to various environments, making them one of the most successful and diverse groups of animals on Earth.</p>
