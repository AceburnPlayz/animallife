    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Animal life on Earth is incredibly diverse. From the smallest insects to the largest mammals, animals inhabit nearly every corner of our planet. They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, each uniquely adapted to their environment.</p>
    <p>Animals play vital roles in ecosystems. They contribute to pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. Some animals are predators, helping to control populations of other species, while others are prey, forming the basis of food chains. The intricate web of interactions between animals and their habitats is crucial for maintaining ecological balance.</p>
    <p>Animals exhibit a fascinating range of behaviors. Some species migrate thousands of miles to find food or suitable breeding grounds, while others use camouflage or mimicry to protect themselves from predators. Social behaviors like cooperation, communication, and hierarchical structures are prevalent in many animal groups, promoting survival and reproduction.</p>
